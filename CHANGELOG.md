## 0.6.2 (unreleased)

### Major Changes

- Enable chroma subsampling by default (may affect saved projects) (#331)

## 0.6.1

Long delayed... sorry.

### Major Changes

- Fix bug where narrow pulse waves were erroneously detected as silence (#306)
- Fix Windows-only crash when opening a non-ASCII path and restarting corrscope (#311)
- Fix bug where unrecognized fonts would cause corrscope to crash (#313)
- Fix bug where `pip install corrscope` failed on Linux because `PyQt5-sip` was pinned to 4.x (#319)

### Changelog

- On Windows, use locale-specific font, not hard-coded Segoe UI (#322)

## 0.6.0

### Features

- Rewrite pitch tracking to avoid false negatives (#274)
    - Previously, we rescaled the *buffer* to maximize spectral similarity between *data 2 frames ago* and data now.
    - Now we rescale the buffer to maximize spectral similarity between the buffer and data now.
- Improve period calculation, add maximum frequency cap (#294)
    - Fixes incorrectly high frequency with low bass notes
    - Fixes incorrectly high frequency with treble-heavy waveforms

### Major Changes

- Update default options for new projects (#275)
    - Stereo grid opacity = 0.25
    - Render FPS Divisor = 2 (preview-only, faster)
    - Trigger Width = 60 ms
- Always enable midline color, remove color checkbox (#291)
    - Can be disabled separately for h/v
- Enable grid color #55aaff for new projects (#300)

### Changelog

- Increase GUI maximum Trigger/Render Width to 200 ms
- Update trigger GUI, merge all edge-related triggers (#299)
- Rewrite FPS printing code
- Add test to ensure cancelling render terminates FFmpeg quickly
- Add support for excluding fields from always_dump="*" (#268)
    - Don't dump viewport_width/height by default

## 0.5.1

This is a bugfix release, since master has regressions in pitch tracking.

### Changelog

- Improve GUI dialog path defaults (#277)
- Display all GUI errors in dialog box, instead of crashing (#279)
- Display dialog and terminate ffmpeg, when closing project with preview/render active (#280)


## 0.5.0

### Breaking Changes

- Reorganize GUI, move trigger options to tab
- Improve NES triangle triggering, switch data window to Gaussian (#244)
- Remove mean responsiveness (always set to 1)
    - To improve triangle waves, use sign triggering instead.

### Features

- Add sign triggering (37d2c08a)
- Add support for per-channel labels (#256)
    - Some fonts may not work or display the wrong weight, due to Matplotlib issues.
- Add configurable grid line width (#265)
- Add Ctrl+Tab or Ctrl+PageUp/Down shortcuts to switch GUI tabs (#246)

### Changelog

- Quit GUI when pressing Ctrl-C in terminal (#252)
- Rewrite resolution division system to use internal DPI (#264)
- Refactor renderer API (c8239558)
- Add renderer debugging visualizations (development only)


## 0.4.0

### Breaking Changes

- Set default mean responsiveness to 0.05 instead of 1 (even in unmodified older files, oops)
- Always use full-resolution rendering, when rendering to file (make trigger/render subsampling preview-only)
- Remove buffer falloff from GUI (defaults to 0.5)
- Lag prevention is no longer increased, when trigger subsampling or trigger width Ã— are >1

### Features

- Add Help menu (online help manual)
- Add custom stereo downmix modes
    - Allow left-only triggering, downmixing specific channels to mono, etc.
- Add post-triggering for finding zero-crossing edges
- Add optional slope-based triggering
    - Previous edge-triggering was area-based and located zero crossings

### Changelog

- Add trigger "buffer responsiveness" option
- Remove dependency on more_itertools


## 0.3.1

### Breaking Changes
- Fix time-traveling bug by reverting "Increase trigger diameter to improve bass stability" from 0.3.0

### Changelog

- Rebuild UI in Python, not .ui XML
- Show stack trace dialog when loading config fails
- Show stack trace dialog if exceptions raised before playback begins


## 0.3.0

### Breaking Changes

- Increase trigger diameter to improve bass stability
- Line width is now measured in pixels. (previously, 1 pt = 4/3 px)
- Tweak default config settings: white lines, gray midlines, 1 column, vertical orientation.
    - Enable preview-only resolution divisor by default, to boost speed

### Features

- Add pitch-tracking trigger checkbox
    - Waves should no longer jump around when pitch changes.
    - Rapidly repeating pitch changes (less than 6 frames apart) are skipped for performance.
    - Pitch tracking may increase CPU usage on noise channels. See https://github.com/corrscope/corrscope/issues/213 for details
- Add stereo rendering support
    - Located in stereo tab in GUI
- Add per-channel amplification support
- Add color picker to GUI
- Add unit suffixes to GUI spinboxes

### Changelog

- Prevent YAML dump from line-breaking long paths
- Dump Config.show_internals to YAML by default
- Add non-GUI option to disable antialiasing (does not improve performance)
